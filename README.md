# bci4als-2022-python
Python framework for the 2022 BCI4ALS course

## Basic Usage

For now, in order to run the framework with pycharm, you should select the repository root directory, right click and mark as -> sources root. Then select new_bci_framework, right click and mark as -> Namespace Package.  
In the future we will make this into an actual package so that we can skip this step.  
Additional documentation for this codebase will be uploaded in the future.  
Feel free to fork the repository, open pull requests or issues, or use as-is.
